Just paste the code into visual studio and run it. If visual studio does not recognise atomicAdd, remove that line and remove the include of intellisense at the top of the file. On my RTX 4060, it calculates about 20 billion md5 hashes each second.

Thats pretty fast! As far as I know, no one has made public such a program before, only programs to crack a given hash. Enjoy! 

If you find one with at least 15 leading zeros (good luck with that) then this site might be some fun: https://beneri.se/hashgame/
